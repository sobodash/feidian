Please read changes.txt for information about newly supported commands.

For reference, this README is really more of a case study to give the user a
feel for how this program can actually be applied to real scenarios. I think
something like this helps people ot see the actual value of a program a lot
more than just a list of commands would.

 i. What is FEIDIAN?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you've downloaded FEIDIAN. I'm already impressed. Nobody EVER uses anything
I write, so I'm just, wow, I'm impressed.

So what is FEIDIAN? FEIDIAN is a tool for going between monochrome bitmap and
monochrome bitplane (aka 1bpp) graphic formats at any size whatsoever. If
you're new to the concept of bitplane graphics, basically it works like this.
You have a tile. It can be any width and any height. And tiles of this size
are repeated again and again for as long as whatever is getting stores is
being stored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ii. Standard bitplane font format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let's take a VERY common tile size, 8x16. This means the tile is 8 bits
wide and 16 bits tall. Since a byte is 8 bits, this tile would be 16 bytes in
the file ((8*16)/8). Simple, yes? I thought so.

So far, we're still in the realm of things every other tile tool on the planet
can do -- that being multiples of 8. People like working with bytes because
they're fast and fairly regular. When you get into tiles that do not store
their rows in complete bytes, it can get a little hairy.

Say you have a file that is 12x14. That means there are 12 bits to a line. Good
luck finding a tile editor that will handle that. If you find one, send the
author a hearty thank you because virtually NOBODY fells like adding support
for such widths, even though it's INCREDIBLY common.

So how are these 12 bits being stored? Well, most commonly, multiple bytes are
just hooked together in a long, wrapping bit string. Let's pretend our first
byte is "A," our second is "B," and so on. A will be repeated 8 times for each
bit in A.

                               AAAAAAAABBBB
                               BBBBCCCCCCCC
                               DDDDDDDDEEEE
                               EEEEFFFFFFFF
                               ...

And so on. This means we have one full byte on the first line, the upper nibble
(4 bits of a byte) on that line, the lower nibble on the next line, then the
next byte. Then the pattern repeats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 iii. Creating a custom tile definition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So FEIDIAN will handle the above example, since it's all one after another. But
what if you ran across a REALLY queer game that used something 12x12, but did
not even bother keeping the bits in that logical an order (*cough* NCS/Masaya's
Der Langrisser *cough*). In Der Langrisser, your bits are like this:

                               AAAAAAAABBBB
                               CCCCCCCCBBBB
                               DDDDDDDDEEEE
                               FFFFFFFFEEEE
                               ...

Well uh-oh. FEIDIAN is not a crystal ball, so it can't see every possible tile
pattern imaginable. But it DOES allow the user to create their own custom tile
patterns! This is quite possibly the most useful feature in FEIDIAN.

How does one do this? First off, download any sample template off the FEIDIAN
webpage (http://feidian.sourceforge.net/) and pop it open in Notepad, vi,
or if you're scared to use a computer, pico. This file is heavily commented
(a comment is a line beginning with //) and should give you all the info you
need. But in case it's not enough, I'll walk you through making one from
scratch.

First off, a tile definition needs to say how tall and how wide a tile is.
There are two variables in the file to do this: $tile_width and $tile_height
(in PHP, a variable always has $ before the name). So for our 12x12 tile
example, we would write:
  $tile_width  = 12;
  $tile_height = 12;
Easy! Next, we need to define out above pattern. Well let's think carefully, so
we can keep our pattern as lean as possible. In the above example, the pattern
repeats itself after byte C. So that means, we only need to define up to that.
  $byte_order  = "AAAAAAAABBBB
                  CCCCCCCCBBBB";
Voila. You have just defined your byte pattern. That was the hardest part! The
only thing left is to say how many bytes are needed for the pattern. In this
case, it's three bytes (A, B and C). So we'll put:
  $pat_size    = 3;

You're all done! Save your file with a meaningful name with the extension .php.
(For this example, I chose dl.php since it's Der Langrisser). Also make sure
the first line of your file is "<?" and the last is "?>" Otherwise, FEIDIAN
will crash if you try to use it.

So, easy enough so far? I hope so.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 iv. Extracting a font
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now it's time to actually dump the font. You need to know where it begins at
in the ROM. This I cannot help you with, you'll need to either debug and find
where it's loading from, or use your eyeballs and a lot of patience! Neill
Corlett's "Nana" tile viewer can be very helpful for this, but it can't show
anything that's not a multiple of 8 in 1bpp. There's a trick though, to help
you with 12x12 tiles. Since the width is 12, the nearest multiple of 8 would
be 24. If you set the width to 24, it should help you find your tiles (though
it will look broken).

Find the offset in the file where your tiles begin and write it down. It should
be something like 0xdeadbeef (poor example, but dead beef is my favorite kind).
Armed with the offset, your tile size, or your custom definition, you are
ready to use FEIDIAN.

FEIDIAN is capable of three modes. Insertion, ripping, and creating custom
tile sets using a list of letters (more on this later!) The modes are:

  r - rips bitplane to bitmap
  i - injects bitplane to bitmap
  d - creates dual-letter set.

There's also a prefix, "c," for when you're using a custom set.

If we were going with our very first example, which was not a custom tile, we
would run FEIDIAN like this:

  feidian -r 12,12,16,16,0xdeadbeef ourrom.rom output

This is a VERY simple command line. Let's go through its components.

  width,height,rows,columns,offset

The width is your tile width, 12. The height is also 12 for this example.
The 16 is how many tiles should be in a column. The next 16 is how many rows
of tiles you want to dump. The above example would dump the first 256 12x12
tiles located at 0xdeadbeef in ourrom.rom. It would output a bitmap of them
to output_12x12.bmp.

Easy enough? Kick ass.

Now for our Der Langrisser example, it's a bit different.

  feidian -cr dl,16,16,0x11814c derlang.smc output

Notice the -cr? That means we're using a custom tile definition. Out command
line is the same as before, except now, we replace the tile width and height
with out custom definition (which we saved as dl.php). Your definition should
be in the /tiles/ folder of the FEIDIAN directory.

The offset shown is actually the real offset for Der Langrisser's 12x12 tiles.
So have you followed the walkthrough so far, this is actually a functional
command line you could use to dump that font.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v. Inserting a font
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok. So now you're a master of making your own tile definitions and dumping
fonts with FEIDIAN. What else can it do? Well, let's take that nifty
output_12x12.bmp we just made an crack it open in Paintbrush. Flood the thing
with black and bust open the text tool (white text, black background). Make
a big textbox and type something fun, like

  "I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE HOW ANNOYING
  THE STUPID SSH SYSTEM IS FOR
  UPLOADING NEW FILES.

Now, let's try this.

  feidian -ci dl,16,16,0x11814c output_12x12.bmp derlang.smc

Congratulations, you have just replaced all those first tiles in Der Langrisser
with the above text. This is totally useless, since you can't see it in the
game right now (unless you inserted a string of all those first tiles in a row),
but this shows how FEIDIAN can insert a graphic back into the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 vi. Building a dual-letter font
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would this be useful? We're getting there, hold your horses.

First off, we will need a font. A FONT YOU SAY?! Yes, but not just any font.
It needs to be half the width of our desired tile size, 16 columns wide, and 16
rows high. Yes, 256 tiles. And they need to correspond to the ASCII ordering.

Aren't I demanding? Well, since I'm not a totally heartless bastard, I'm
thinking of implementing a system to let you make a corresponding text map to
a bitmap, so you only need ot include the letters you want. But that's down the
development road.

So we need to make a graphic that has 16 rows and 16 columns of 6x12 tiles on
it. Rather, YOU need to. Get to work, Photoshop whore!

When you've done this, copy and paste it into Paintbrush and save it as a
monochrome bitmap (it's in the dropdown list). Adobe doesn't like complying
with the M$ BITMAP standards, so while it may rock for drawing, it will eat
your graphic if you save. And if that happens, FEIDIAN won't like you anymore.
It might even give you a severe, acute respiratory syndrome, just for looking
at it funny (hah, get it? FEIDIAN. HAH).

Next up, you need a list. A LIST?! A list! And it should have two letters on
each line. Here's an example:

  I 
  do
   n
  ot
   l
  ik
  e 
  te
  nt
  ac
  le
   m
  on
  st
  er
  s.

Save that as something like "japan.txt"

So here goes our command line fun!
  feidian -d 6,12,japan.txt my_6x12.bmp output

This could take a while, so be patient. What this will do is make a new 12x12
font where each 12x12 tile contains one of your two-letter combos written using
the 6x12 font you gave it.

So, if you were doing a 16x16 font, you could follow the above example and
include and 8x16 bitmap instead. I'm sure you're getting the idea.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 vii. Other Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what else can FEIDIAN do? At the moment, a whole lot of  N O T H I N G ! ! !

And the reason for that is, everything else is already covered by another tool.
Just look for something to do it at http://www.romhacking.net/. FEIDIAN is
really just my way of filling in a GAPING need in the world of translation
tools, and it was mostly written to do things I've found myself needing again
and again that no other tool could do.

I hope you find it useful, and if not, do me the courtesy of not insulting me/
flaming my message board/filing bogus complaints with my host causing me to
lose JumpStation.org and $150 in pre-paid service.
