FEIDIAN CHANGE LOG

- v0.4 -

* Expanded tile definitions to 62 bytes. This should cover most any 24x24 tile
  (assuming not EVERY byte needs to be defined, just the pattern). The new
  letter hirearchy is A-Z a-z 0-9. 0-9 was put last instead of first to ensure
  backwards compatability with older definitions.
* Added support for color inversion in the dumps. Inversion is supported in all
  insertion and ripping functions (you have no need for it in dual-tile
  building, even if you think you do). To invert, simply add an "i" to the
  command line.
    Example: feidian.php -cr i mrsaturn,16,6,0x2015b9 eb.smc mrsaturn
  The Mr. Saturn font is stored in Earthbound with its colors reversed. This
  will dump it in the standard 0=transparent 1=color format most games use.
  You could similarly add an "i" to the command line in insertion to flip the
  colors back.

- v0.3 -

* Complete rewrite of the source code.
* Added support for creating dual-tile sets.
* Added support for custom tile definitions.
* Added support for non-8* width fonts.

- v0.2 L31 -

* Initial release
