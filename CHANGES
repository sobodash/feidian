FEIDIAN CHANGE LOG

- v0.6 -
* Tile padding has been added. You can now increase a tile's size by any x,y
  pixels without scaling the tile contents. 0 is assumed as the transparent
  bit (if this is really a problem, just invert your bitmap colors first).
  This function has many uses, noteably preparation of a font for Optical
  Character Recognition (OCR), where an 8-10px spacing is needed for good
  results.
* Binary Character Recognition (BCR) added (invented?). This method allows a
  user to supply a known game font and text representation of it as a source.
  This can vastly reduce the amount of characters one needs to fill in for a
  table, if you have a similar font already done. This can be very useful since
  companies often recycle their fonts between games.
* BDF font output APPEARS to be working, but I don't have a setup available
  to test BDF fonts on. If you use it, and it works, let me know.

- v0.5 -
* FD font output support has been added. FD fonts can be compiled into
  Windows 3.0/3.11/NT/95/98/Me/2000/XP compatable .FON files using the
  excellent mkwinfont by Simon Tatham, available from his page at
  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/fonts/
  I would like to make .FON output automatic from FEIDIAN, but I don't know
  Python. If anyone can give me a nice file format map based off his source, I
  can add it to FEIDIAN.
  NOTE: Source bitmaps for FD output should be 256 tiles in ASCII order.
* Fixed a glitch that caused dual-tile generation to break when the tiles did
  not end evenly on a multiple of 8 bits.

- v0.45a -
* What wonderful luck. When uploading the bug fix release of 0.45, I broke the
  directory structure, rendering the bug fix release EVEN MORE BUGGED! Here's a
  correct version, and I'm very sorry for that mistake. 0.45 has been pulled
  from distribution.

- v0.45 -
* Bug fix release: Added much needed input checking to keep users from
  glitching FEIDIAN with malformed command strings. Also corrected an error
  in the insertion routine for custom tiles using the new 62-byte format.

- v0.4 -
* Expanded tile definitions to 62 bytes. This should cover most any 24x24 tile
  (assuming not EVERY byte needs to be defined, just the pattern). The new
  letter hirearchy is A-Z a-z 0-9. 0-9 was put last instead of first to ensure
  backwards compatability with older definitions.
* Added support for color inversion in the dumps. Inversion is supported in all
  insertion and ripping functions (you have no need for it in dual-tile
  building, even if you think you do). To invert, simply add an "i" to the
  command line.
    Example: feidian.php -cr i mrsaturn,16,6,0x2015b9 eb.smc mrsaturn
  The Mr. Saturn font is stored in Earthbound with its colors reversed. This
  will dump it in the standard 0=transparent 1=color format most games use.
  You could similarly add an "i" to the command line in insertion to flip the
  colors back.

- v0.3 -
* Complete rewrite of the source code.
* Added support for creating dual-tile sets.
* Added support for custom tile definitions.
* Added support for non-8* width fonts.

- v0.2 L31 -
* Initial release
