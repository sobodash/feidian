FEIDIAN CHANGE LOG

- v0.8a -
* Major fix to the custom tile routine. The new hirearchy for custom tile
  letters is: [A-Z] [a-z] [2-9] [!?@*]

- v0.8 -
* COLOR! COLOR! AND THEN MORE COLOR! I fianlly got around to it. This means
  there are a few changes to the tile definition format. You can download any
  of the sample definitions (they've all been edited for compatability) from
  the page and have a look, or check out the definition template that comes
  with FEIDIAN now. Currently, all formats, 16 colors or under, in Klarth's
  console graphics document are supported, as well as some others. This means:
    -   8x8 2bpp NES
    - 16x16 2bpp NES
    -   8x8 2bpp SNES/Gameboy/GBC
    -   8x8 2bpp NeoGeo Pocket Color
    -   8x8 2bpp Virtual Boy
    -   8x8 3bpp SNES
    -   8x8 4bpp SNES/PC-Engine
    -   8x8 4bpp Game Gear/SMS/Wonderswan Color
    -   8x8 4bpp Megadrive/X68000
  There's also a few other tile definitions in development (I hear Kitsune is
  doing an MSX definition, which apparantly NOTHING supports).
* Tile definitions can now include their own dump and insert functions (for
  any adventurous programmers out there). This probably isn't necessary, but
  it's nice to have available.
* Tile definitions support planar or linear byte arrangement (compatability
  with Virtual Boy and NeoGeo Pocket Color)
* Speed-up to tile padding.

- v0.7 (development only) -
* Fixed some of the existing code for compatability with 16-color bitmaps in
  preparation for v0.8.

- v0.6 -
* Tile padding has been added. You can now increase a tile's size by any x,y
  pixels without scaling the tile contents. 0 is assumed as the transparent
  bit (if this is really a problem, just invert your bitmap colors first).
  This function has many uses, noteably preparation of a font for Optical
  Character Recognition (OCR), where an 8-10px spacing is needed for good
  results.
* Binary Character Recognition (BCR) added (invented?). This method allows a
  user to supply a known game font and text representation of it as a source.
  This can vastly reduce the amount of characters one needs to fill in for a
  table, if you have a similar font already done. This can be very useful since
  companies often recycle their fonts between games.
* BDF font output APPEARS to be working, but I don't have a setup available
  to test BDF fonts on. If you use it, and it works, let me know.

- v0.5 -
* FD font output support has been added. FD fonts can be compiled into
  Windows 3.0/3.11/NT/95/98/Me/2000/XP compatable .FON files using the
  excellent mkwinfont by Simon Tatham, available from his page at
  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/fonts/
  I would like to make .FON output automatic from FEIDIAN, but I don't know
  Python. If anyone can give me a nice file format map based off his source, I
  can add it to FEIDIAN.
  NOTE: Source bitmaps for FD output should be 256 tiles in ASCII order.
* Fixed a glitch that caused dual-tile generation to break when the tiles did
  not end evenly on a multiple of 8 bits.

- v0.45a -
* What wonderful luck. When uploading the bug fix release of 0.45, I broke the
  directory structure, rendering the bug fix release EVEN MORE BUGGED! Here's a
  correct version, and I'm very sorry for that mistake. 0.45 has been pulled
  from distribution.

- v0.45 -
* Bug fix release: Added much needed input checking to keep users from
  glitching FEIDIAN with malformed command strings. Also corrected an error
  in the insertion routine for custom tiles using the new 62-byte format.

- v0.4 -
* Expanded tile definitions to 62 bytes. This should cover most any 24x24 tile
  (assuming not EVERY byte needs to be defined, just the pattern). The new
  letter hirearchy is A-Z a-z 0-9. 0-9 was put last instead of first to ensure
  backwards compatability with older definitions.
* Added support for color inversion in the dumps. Inversion is supported in all
  insertion and ripping functions (you have no need for it in dual-tile
  building, even if you think you do). To invert, simply add an "i" to the
  command line.
    Example: feidian.php -cr i mrsaturn,16,6,0x2015b9 eb.smc mrsaturn
  The Mr. Saturn font is stored in Earthbound with its colors reversed. This
  will dump it in the standard 0=transparent 1=color format most games use.
  You could similarly add an "i" to the command line in insertion to flip the
  colors back.

- v0.3 -
* Complete rewrite of the source code.
* Added support for creating dual-tile sets.
* Added support for custom tile definitions.
* Added support for non-8* width fonts.

- v0.2 L31 -
* Initial release
